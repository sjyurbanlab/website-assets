# website-assets
Static assets for the lab website.

To access the static resources uploaded here, construct https urls as follows.

```
https://sjyurbanlab.github.io/website-assets/[directory-structure]/[filename]
```

`[directory-structure]` and `[filename]` should be replaced by the file with the `filename` stored in the `directory-structure`.

For example, https://sjyurbanlab.github.io/website-assets/home/introduction/hong-kong-day.jpg would point to the file `hong-kong-day.jpg` stored in `/home/introduction` directory.
